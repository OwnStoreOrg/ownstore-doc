You can learn more about theming in `tailwind.config.js`. This is the only file for everything related to theming. 

There are few theme color variables we should talk about:

Key | Description
--- | ---
`primary` | App's main theme color.
`lightPrimary` | Used along with `primary` primarily only for hover effects.
`primaryText` | Primary color used for texts.
`primaryTextBold` | Used as dark primary color for texts.
